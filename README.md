# GIS-tutorial
Learning GIS in R, following tutorial from Nick Eubank (https://www.nickeubank.com/gis-in-r/)

I'm fascinated by the world of GIS (Geograpihc Information System), especially it's impact and potential opportunities for conservation and sustainability.

This is my first attempt at using GIS, so I'm following a tutorial I found with a quick internet search.
